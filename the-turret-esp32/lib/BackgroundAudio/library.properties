sentence=Plays MP3, AAC, and WAV via an IRQ based mechanism to allow "multitasking" while playing
paragraph=Uses interrupts to allow a sketch to run while MP3, AAC, or WAV decoding goes on behind the scenes. Decodes in natural frames to optimize CPU usage. Allows for handling the UI of a sketch without stopping or jitter on playback.
